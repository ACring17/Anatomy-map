<h2>List of muscles</h2>
<!--Eventually I would like to make an interactive map with a photo of the human body and each muscle is a link. Will be quite the challenge and will have to learn quite a bit more. For now try to design out the basics of the human body and general applications of muscle phsyiology. -->
<p>Below is a list of all the major muscles. If you are curious on learning more about any of the muscles or groups of muscles below you can click on the muscle to learn more information such as strengthening or stretching movements to help you understand how the body works and ways you can improve yourself.</p>
